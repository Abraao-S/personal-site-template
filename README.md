# personal-site-template
- My first ever website! I did this following a bunch of tutorials and learned a lot during the process, and I will personalize it a little bit and use it as my personal portfolio site.
- The whole site was made using just HTML, CSS and Javascript, no frameworks for now
- The site is fully responsive for any screen size

## What I learned doing this project:
- Structure the page to work as a single-page application;
- Create a navigation hamburger menu with Javascript;
-  Use CSS media queries to build a responsive page;
- Use CSS pseudo-elements to style my section titles and other things;
- Use CSS pseudo-classes to change the style based on user interaction (like hover);
